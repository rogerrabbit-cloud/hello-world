# hello-world
This is the first step into the coding world.
(Something about myself) The initial impression I had when starting this sight was a positive one. I am so grateful to be here and be anle to practice my job. I started programming in the 1998 round about, with visual basics. I was a student that was finished with the assignment for the week, and programmed something "extra." I am looking to be a part of security and the IoT available in the company. Steps in the direction are made daily. Stay blessed. D
